            <p>Another portfolio, and I am STILL not ready to write an About Me page during the assignment itself.
                I mean, seriously, I&apos;m doing this assignment a bit early because it&apos;s actually due on my
                gosh darn birthday. Right before a 3 day weekend! Everything about this assignment is filler to meet
                the requirements so I can go enjoy my last birthday before turning 30. This won&apos;t be here when I&apos;m
                applying for jobs, honest.
