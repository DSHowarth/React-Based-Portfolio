# React-Based-Portfolio

## Description

This is a webdev portfolio, made by me, using React. It doesn't look good yet, but it will before anyone sees this.

## Usage

[Visit the site here](https://chimerical-monstera-77754c.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- React
- Vite
- React Router 

## Lessons Learned

- Bootstrap has its own set of React components available at https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/. It is very convenient for someone who doesn't enjoy writing html.
- Because React Router uses its own components (Outlet, Link, etc.), any premade components might not work. Luckily, I'm not the first person to have 
this problem, as [there is an npm package out there to fix the issue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-bootstrap).
